Lemma 16. ({x,y} \subset CP(U) suffices. No edge needed.)

Lemma 16'. Let xyz be a triangle in the link graph and. Then at
most two of x,y, and z are checkpoints between any given points.

Lemma 17.

Let xyz be a triangle in CP(U). Then there exist elements
x',y',z' in U such that {x,y} \subset CP(x',y').

Proof.

Using Lemma 16, we obtain elements x' and y' such that {x,y} \subset CP(x',y').
By Lemma 16', we have that z is not a checkpoint between x' and y'.
Fix an irredundant x'y'-path p avoiding z.
Assume, without loss of generality, that x appears before y in p.
Hence we can split p into an x'x-path p1, an xy-path p2, and a yy'-path p3.
All three paths avoid z.
Further p1 avoids y and p3 also avoids x.
Using Lemma 16 again, we also obtain elements x" and z' such that {x,z} \subset CP(x",z').
Using the same reasoning as above, we obtain an x"x-path q1, an xz-path q2, and a zz'-path q3
such that all three paths avoid y, q1 also avoids z, and q3 also avoids x.
We claim that x',y' and z' satisfy the conditions of the statement.
We first show {x,z} \subset CP(x',z')
For x, assume some x'z'-path r avoiding x and let r' be an zy-path avoiding x.
Then r+(rev q3)+r'+p3 is an x'y-path avoiding x, contradicting that x is a checkpoint between x' and y'.
For z, assume some x'z'-path r avoiding z.
Then q1+(rev p1)+r is an x"z'-path avoiding z, contradicting that x is a checkpoint between x" and z'.
To show that y is a checkpoint between y' and z', assume some z'y'-path r avoiding y.
Then p1+q2+q3+r is an x'y'-path avoiding y, contradiction.
Using a similar argument, we obtain that z is a checkpoint between y' and z'.

Qed.
