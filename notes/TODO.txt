* Path/Trees
revisit uses of upath (CD)
* Checkpoints
change checkpoints to use "connect restrict" 
phrase sinterval in terms of checkpoints
define CP as set on the link graph?
prove CP_tree / K4_split_nontrivial using CP rather than CP_
* Isomorphism
iso_cases Ltac wrapper (using iso_gI)
* Proofs that need cleanup
use skeleton and sgraph tree decompositions in subalgebra (CD)
K4-free-of-TW2
K4_split_nontrivial (GC)
