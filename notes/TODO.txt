* Path/Trees
revisit uses of upath (CD)
packaged irredundant paths (CD)
consistent tree/forest theory (CD) 
trees/forests as sets on graphs (like connected) (CD)
* Checkpoints
change checkpoints to use "connect restrict" 
phrase sinterval in terms of checkpoints
define CP as set on the link graph?
prove CP_tree / K4_split_nontrivial using CP rather than CP_
* Multigraphs
edge_set as big union of edges (GC: current def seems better)
* Isomorphism
iso_cases Ltac wrapper (using iso_gI)
make (h x != h y) an assumption in hom_s
* Proofs that need cleanup
forest properties for combinations of forests
use skeleton in subalgebra
K4-free-of-TW2
CP_treeI (use packaged paths as much as possible) (GC - blocked)
K4_split_nontrivial (GC - blocked)
