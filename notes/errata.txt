p6. Proof of Lemma 11: "there must be a sub path of it" -> the xy-path? (presumably) \pi? \pi'?

p6. Lemma 14: "...the sequence obtained by keeping only the elements in CP(U)..." ->
    	      "...the sequence obtained by keeping only the elements in CP(U)
	       and compessing successive occurrences into a single one..."

p6. Lemma 16: "If xy is an edge in CP(U)" -> If {x,y} \subseteq CP(U)

p7. Proposition 21(ii) appears to be not used at all

Suggestions:

p8. Use the the more specific "Proposition 21(i)" in proof of Prop. 22.
