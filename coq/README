** A Coq library on graphs and 2p algebra **

This library contains

- a general purpose library about graph theory:
  . directed graphs, simple graphs, multigraphs
  . paths, trees, forests
  . minors
  . tree decompositions
  . Menger's theorem and some of its corollaries (Hall's marriage theorem and KÃ¶nig's theorem)
  . the excluded-minor characterisation of treewidth at most two graphs (as those excluding K4 as a minor)

- a study on treewidth at most two graphs and their links with algebraic structures:
  . isomorphisms on multigraphs
  . TW2 graphs form a 2p algebra (and thus also a 2pdom algebra)
  . every K4-free graph can be represented by a 2p-term
  . 2pdom axioms are complete w.r.t graph isomorphism

Parts of this library are described in the following papers
- Graph Theory in Coq: Minors, Treewidth, and Isomorphisms,
  C. Doczkal, D. Pous, submitted to special issue of ITP'18 (JAR)
  https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02316859/document
- Completeness of an Axiomatization of Graph Isomorphism via Graph Rewriting in Coq,
  C. Doczkal, D. Pous, submitted to CPP'20
  https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02333553/document

The first one describes the general purpose part of the library, with the soundness result for 2p algebra axioms and the extraction of 2p-terms from K4-free graphs as applications.
The second one focuses on the completeness proof for 2pdom axioms, which is obtained by proving confluence of a graph rewrite system.


** Installation **

To build the theory files you need:

   coq-8.9.1 or coq-8.10,
   coq-mathcomp-ssreflect-1.9.0 or coq-mathcomp-ssreflect-1.10.0
   coq-mathcomp-finmap-1.4

   (all available with opam)

Then run:

   make


** Documentation **

An overall description of the files and their organisation is given in files.txt.

To build the developemnt and the HTML documentation (with foldable proofs provided by CoqDocJS) run:

   make html

and point your browser to "html/toc.htm".

The documentation can also be browsed online at:

  https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/damien.pous/covece/graphs/


A point on terminology:
- 2p, which stands for "2 pointed", becomes "ptt" in the code 
- 2pdom becomes "pttdom" 


** Note **

This development is under active development; please see the URL above for updated versions.


** Authors **

This library is being developed by Christian Doczkal (Inria Sophia Antipolis) and Damien Pous (CNRS, LIP, ENS de Lyon), as part of the ERC project CoVeCe.

Guillaume Combette also participated significantly in in the early stages of the develpoment.
