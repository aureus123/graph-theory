structures: setoids, bisetoids, monoids
pttdom: pttdom algebras, algebras of terms, tests ...
mgraph: labelled multigraphs
mgraph2: pointed multigraphs, pttdom algebra of such graphs
rewriting: definition of the rewriting system
reduction: rewriting system powerful enough to reach normal forms
open: open graphs, open local confluence proof
completeness: wrapping up everything into a completeness proof



with the following dependencies:

              structures                            
	     mgraph  pttdom
	        mgraph2
               rewriting
           reduction    open
	     completeness


Note: one could break the dependency on mgraph2->pttdom if [pttdom.pttdom] was defined in structures.v (would make sense actually)


files ending in _bak.v are supposed to disappear once
- their interesting content has been imported elsewhere
- the modules built on top of them have been ported to the new files
(some files in attic/ could also be removed)


status of file confluence.v remains to be determined


the extraction_iso/top and corollaries modules still depend on some _bak files ...
we'll have to port them to the new mgraph (possibly hard) or just remove them
