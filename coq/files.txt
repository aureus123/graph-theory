structures: setoids, bisetoids, monoids
pttdom: pttdom algebras, algebras of terms, tests ...
mgraph: labelled multigraphs, pointed multigraphs, pttdom algebra of such graphs
rewriting: definition of the rewriting system
reduction: rewriting system powerful enough to reach normal forms
???,???: open graphs, confluence proof
completeness: wrapping up everything into a completeness proof



with the following dependencies:

              structures
                pttdom            
	        mgraph       
              rewriting
                       ???
       reduction	  ???
	     completeness


Note: one could break the dependency on mgraph->pttdom if [pttdom.pttdom] was defined in structures.v (would make sense actually)


files ending in _bak.v are supposed to disappear once
- their interesting content has been imported elsewhere
- the modules built on top of them have been ported to the new files
(some files in attic/ could also be removed)


status of files open.v and confluence.v remains to be checked
