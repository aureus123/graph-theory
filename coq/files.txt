	      corollaries


*** CPP20 submission
structures:		setoids, bisetoids, monoids
pttdom: 		2pdom-algebras, algebras of terms, tests ...
mgraph: 		labelled multigraphs
mgraph2: 		pointed multigraphs, 2pdom algebra of such graphs
rewriting: 		definition of the rewriting system
reduction: 		rewriting system powerful enough to reach normal forms
open_confluence: 	open graphs, open local confluence proof
transfer: 		transfer lemmas between the open and packed representations of 2p-graphs
completeness: 		wrapping up everything into a completeness proof

              structures                            
	     mgraph  pttdom
	        mgraph2

        reduction    open_confluence
                        transfer
	     completeness

Note: one could break the dependency on mgraph2->pttdom if [pttdom.pttdom] was defined in structures.v (would make sense actually)
