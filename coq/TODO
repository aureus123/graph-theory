- port term extraction (ITP18/JAR19) to the more general notion of graphs introduced for CPP20
  (so that we can remove files mgraph_jar.v and mgraph2_jar.v, which are subsumed by mgraph.v and mgraph2.v)

- solve rewriting/setoid_rewriting/Type/irewrite...

- get completeness for 2p algebra axioms by extending the rewrite system

- develop the equational theories of 2p and 2pdom algebra in a modular way
  (to avoid code duplication between ptt.v and pttdom.v)

- use packed classes for getting a more fine-grain presentation of the structures we employ,
  without running into efficiency problems
  . for multigraphs and 2-pointed multigraphs (which inherit finType)
  . for setoids, labels, pttdom, ptt and related structures

- conservativity proof of 2p over 2pdom

- simpler term extraction via the rewrite system? (requires expansion)
